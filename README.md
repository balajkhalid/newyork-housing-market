# New York Housing Market

## Abstract
<p>In this project, I developed a multi-layer perceptron from the ground up to tackle a classification challenge. Specifically, I utilized a modified version of a dataset originally found on Kaggle, which is derived from real-world data pertaining to the New York housing market. The primary objective of this project is to accurately predict the number of bedrooms in a given property based on various input features. </p>
